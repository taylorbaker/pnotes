# Orator Krix'vizk Trash

Clear logical bee-line path to boss, generally without pulling more than two packs at same time. Lot of opportunity to overpull for count, but doesn't seem necessary based on beta footage. Can save final Scarab pack to be pulled with boss, as they are little more than health sponges. 

Beware the timing of dispelling Shadows of Doubt, as it will send out orbs that deal shadow dmg from the target and stun players (causing potentially lethal overlaps). This is also good practice for the same mechanic on the first boss, Krix'vizk.

mobs:

- Sureki Silkbinder (ID 220195)
  - Web Bolt - *low-priority interrupt*: mild nature dmg with heavy slow
  - Silk Binding - *high-priority interrupt asap*: cc's friendly player
- Sureki Venomblade (ID 220193)
  - Venom Strike - initial physical dmg with nature dot
- Royal Swarmguard (ID 220197)
  - Earthshatter - nature dmg frontal with knockback
  - Ravenous Swarm - unavoidable group-wide ticking nature dmg
- Herald Of Ansurek (ID 220196)
  - Twist Thoughts - *high-priority interrupt*: nuke target player and drop poop
  - Shadows of Doubt - ***stand still*** *or make minor position adjustments to minimize wave splash/let friendlies know where is safe*: shadow dmg dot that launches shadow dmg waves from afflicted player(s) on dispel/expiration, up to *magic dispellers* to control timing
- Battle Scarab (ID 220199) - only auto-attacks lol

ui includes:

- Shadows of Doubt debuff (just Doubt?)
- Venom Strike dot
# Orator Krix'vizk

[wh dungeon journal - Orator Krix'vizk](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=216619/orator-krixvizk)

On first damage, Krix'vizk will grip all players to her and keep them in close proximity for the entire fight. Standing outside the indicated range will grip any outside player (just like start of fight). This creates an interesting push/pull dynamic with player positioning as the entire group will need to reposition after Vociferous Indoctrination casts fill the available space with poop (Lingering Influence). Players need to anticipate tank positioning or face being gripped by boss.

To complicate things, two players will regularly be hit with Shadows of Doubt, which spreads shadow waves on expiration (or dispel). These players should do their best to stand still unless forced to move by the boss frontal (Terrorize) or to get out of the other debuffed player's wave path.

Be smart with boss positioning on higher keys, as Lingering Influence persists the entire fight. This may lead to clearing more trash early to allow for more encounter room, if needed.

core abilities:

- Chains of Oppression - *stay within 10 yds of boss: players stood outside boss proximity take shadow dmg and are gripped back in*
- Subjugate - ***tank buster***, *shadow and physical dmg with slow debuff*
- Terrorize - *shadow dmg frontal that applies a fear*
- Shadows of Doubt - ***stand still*** *or make minor position adjustments to minimize wave splash/let friendlies know where is safe*: shadow dmg dot that launches shadow dmg waves from afflicted player(s) on dispel/expiration, up to *magic dispellers* whether to stagger
- Vociferous Indoctrination - *get ready to* ***anticipate tank movement on cast finish***, *relocate with tank*: drop large poop puddle (Lingering Influence) on boss, forcing movement
- Lingering Influence - ticking shadow dmg to those standing in poop

ui includes:

- Subjugate debuff
- Shadows of Doubt debuff

# Fangs of the Queen Trash (RP Spy Event)

Pull miniboss Xeph'itik onto the bridge to prevent prematurely starting the event. Once miniboss reaches 50%, shadowy figures will spawn demonstrating the Spy Event mechanic. Figures will point in series to an Eye of the Queen (Spy) add that needs to be killed. Killing four of these spies end the event and spawn the boss.

The remaining Spies seem to be evenly spread throughout the event area, identified by more "breadcrumb" shadow figures. Maneuver the area, pulling or avoiding trash and true-sighters while looking for the remaining shadowy figures. May need to coordinate an interrupt rotation for Webmancers, as both casts are priority interrupts and the final Spy has all three key mobs with her.

After the fourth Spy is killed, go to Executor Nizrek until he begins walking. Then head up to the boss area.

mobs:

- Eye of the Queen (Spy) (ID 220003)
  - Void Rush - *multiple players get targeted for large physical dmg followed by shadow dot*
  - Null Slam - *avoid frontal on random player*: shadowsteps to random ally's position for large frontal for lethal shadow dmg
- Agile Pursuer (ID 223181)
  - Knife Throw - deals physical dmg at random player
- Web Marauder (ID 223182)
  - Rigorous Jab - physical dmg that applies stacking debuff increasing dmg taken from Rigorous Jab
- Covert Webmancer (ID 223844)
  - Grimweave Blast - *high-priority interrupt*: initial nature dmg that cleaves chain-lightning style
  - Mending Web - *high-priority interrupt*: big heal on enemy mobs
- Retired Lord Vul'azak (ID 220423) - copy of the Royal Swarmguard
  - Earthshatter - nature dmg frontal with knockback
  - Ravenous Swarm - unavoidable group-wide ticking nature dmg

ui includes:

- Void Rush dot
- Rigorous Jab stacks
- mark Covert Webmancers?

# Fangs of the Queen

[Nx and Vx, Fangs of the Queen](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=216648/nx) share health and alternate between attacking and supporting roles so that they are never in the same role at the same time. On beta, seemed like Nx was always first active, meaning Nx would routinely cast Shade Slash while Vx would cast Ice Sickles and Knife Throw. After reaching 100 energy, both bosses will channel Synergic Step and begin dashing across the room (dealing physical dmg, should be dodged).

After each Synergic Step both bosses swap forms. After its first cast, this would then mean Vx would be attacking and Nx supporting. Vx attacks with Rime Dagger, which is initially a physical tank buster with group frost dmg, but also applies 10 stacks of Freezing Blood. This creates a proximity aoe around the tank that needs to be soaked by as many party members as possible (more soakers means shorter duration). At 100 energy, bosses will again channel Synergic Step, dash around, and then swap forms, repeating ad nauseum.

Minimize movement by planning the positioning of Nx for Duskbringers (both forms) and Shade Slashes (when attacking). There are some nasty, but consistent overlaps with Duskbringer and Rime Dagger, where players need to keep an eye out for soaking the tank's Freezing Blood stacks while needing to reposition (due to Duskbringer).

As dps/heals its likely best to pay most attention to Vx's form, anticipating whether to spread for Ice Sickles or stack following Rime Dagger. As tank, it's likely best to focus on Nx's form and have a plan for positioning either Shade Slashes (spread when attacking) or Freezing Blood removal (stack when supporting).

core abilities:

- Vx
  - Ice Sickles (when supporting) - ***spread relative to Vx*** *so your "line" (trajectory from him to you) doesn't splash frost dmg on friendlies (along with dot)*
  - Rime Dagger (when attacking) - ***tank buster*** *for initial physical dmg and Freezing Blood applications, then burst of frost dmg to group*
  - Freezing Blood - ***soak tank's proximity aoe*** *to clear tank stacks: the more the merrier*
- Nx
  - Shade Slash (when attacking) - *dodge large frontal, along with any previous frontals*: leaves behind a shade of Nx (Echoing Shade) that duplicates any previous Slashes each time Shade Slash is cast
  - Duskbringer (both attacking and supporting) - *get 15+ yds away from boss and any Echoing Shades*: deals heavy, quickly pulsing shadow dmg around Nx and any existing Echoing Shades
- Knife Throw - targets random player for initial and dot dmg, both physical
- Synergic Step - *repeatedly dodge boss' telegraphed dashes*: deals physical dmg to anyone hit, then bosses swap between attacking and supporting roles. occurs at 100 energy

ui includes:

- Knife Throw debuff
- Ice Sickles stacks
- Freezing Blood stacks

# Coaglamation Trash

Likely able to pull pretty aggressively up through stairs, headed toward the Venomshell (you've seen most of these key mobs before).

Once inside, seems meta to go right (as there's one less rather large Unstable Test Subject pack down the hall). Touching a web around the sides of the hallways will spawn a Neophyte, which I don't believe contribute to count (they are not included in MDT 5.0.7) but are damage sponges. Main interrupts will be the Sureki Unnaturaler's Void Wave, which will knock the target back, likely into webs. Very easy to cause a chain reaction to either break webs or aggro Sureki Unnaturalers, causing more knockbacks.

Pull down hall, then down stairs and clear the Congealed Droplet pack to spawn boss.

mobs:

- Sureki Conscript (ID 223357)
  - Brutal Jab - initial physical dmg with echoed dmg on next hit, applies stacking debuff increasing dmg taken from Brutal Jab
- Royal Venomshell (ID 220730)
  - Venomous Spray - *survive heavy pulsing nature dmg, then dodge raining poop*
  - Earthshatter - heavy nature dmg frontal with knockback
- Unstable Test Subject (ID 216328)
  - Fierce Stomping - *survive heavy pulsing physical dmg*
  - Dark Barrage - *dodge purple poop*
- Assistant Unnaturaler (ID 216342)
  - Charge - *don't think can be dodged, but prob don't stack*: charges random player position for physical dmg
- Sureki Unnaturaler (ID 216339)
  - Void Wave - *high-priority interrupt to prevent knockback*: applies stacking shadow dot that knocks back (into webs, spawning Neophytes)
- Neophyte (ID ?)
  - Void Bolt - *low-priority interrupt*
- Congealed Droplet (ID 216329) - no abilities

carry-over mobs:

- Herald Of Ansurek (ID 220196)
  - Twist Thoughts - *high-priority interrupt*: nuke target player and drop poop
  - Shadows of Doubt - ***stand still*** *or make minor position adjustments to minimize wave splash/let friendlies know where is safe*: shadow dmg dot that launches shadow dmg waves from afflicted player(s) on dispel/expiration, up to *magic dispellers* to control timing
- Agile Pursuer (ID 223181)
  - Knife Throw - deals physical dmg at random player
- Web Marauder (ID 223182)
  - Rigorous Jab - physical dmg that applies stacking debuff increasing dmg taken from Rigorous Jab
- Covert Webmancer (ID 223844)
  - Grimweave Blast - *high-priority interrupt*: initial nature dmg that cleaves chain-lightning style
  - Mending Web - *high-priority interrupt*: big heal on enemy mobs

ui includes:

- Brutal Jab stacks
- Void Wave stacks
- mark Sureki Unnaturalers for Void Wave interrupts?

# Coaglamation

[The Coaglamation](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=216320/the-coaglamation)

Soak orbs that spawn after the Viscous Darkness knock-up. Be mindful of positioning on Blood Surge casts to not close off walkways with the poop that drops at players' feet (Black Blood). Poop deals ticking shadow dmg and slows. Soaking orbs will prevent the boss heal, but apply a heal absorb to the player (Corrupted Coating). Be mindful of your health, anticipated incoming damage, and your current absorb when soaking.

Prioritize soaking orbs but be especially careful when boss is approaching 100 energy. This is when Coaglamation casts Dark Pulse, which can be a pretty aggressive healing check on prog keys. It's bad for the boss to heal, but it can also be bad to gather a massive healing absorb soaking orbs right before heavy group damage. Stay thirsty, my friend, but drink responsibly.

Survive Dark Pulse, and once you regather, it's rinse and repeat. Black Blood does eventually despawn, but team will benefit from good management of area denial (through positioning during Blood Surge).

core abilities:

- Oozing Smash - ***tank buster*** *for shadow dmg and healing received debuff*
- Viscous Darkness - *after knock-up, soak orbs to prevent boss heal, but take personal heal absorb (Corrupted Coating)*: only soak if the heal absorb won't kill you, but soaking is high-priority
- Blood Surge - *players drop poop forcing movement*: standing in poop deals ticking shadow dmg and slows
- Dark Pulse (100 Energy) - *heavy pulsing shadow dmg to group for duration of cast*

ui includes:

- Corrupted Coating absorb
- Black Blood debuff

# Izo, Grand Splicer Trash

When both minibosses spawn, group will be most vulnerable during overlaps where everyone is CC'd by the Shadeweaver's Umbral Weave during the Warshell's Tremor Slam (where everyone needs to avoid poop swirlies). Interrupt Web Bolt on a low priority, slightly higher when Tremor Slam is going out.

Boss spawns very quickly after last miniboss dies! If healer is wanting a drink or if combat should be dropped for any other reason, leave the center area when mobs die.

mobs:

- Elder Shadeweaver (ID 221102)
  - Web Bolt - *med-priority interrupt*: deals nature dmg and applies slow
  - Umbral Weave - *loosely stack and prepare to cleave down rooting adds*: roots players, spawns mobs on players, and deals ticking shadow dmg until imprisoning mobs are killed
  - Shadow Shield - *burn shield to end silence immunity*
- Hulking Warshell (ID 221103)
  - Ravenous Swarm - *endure ticking nature dmg*
  - Tremor Slam - *nature dmg to group and additional nature dmg to anyone in 12 yd proximity, dodge poop that spawn Ravenous Scarabs*

  - Gorge - physical dmg to target, increases stacks of Gorged
  - Gutburst - *on 5 stacks of Gorged, suicides with large pulses of aoe nature dmg (lasting 4 sec)*

carry-over mobs:

# Izo, Grand Splicer 

[Izo, Grand Splicer](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=216658/izo-the-grand-splicer)

Boss inherits the Umbral Weave and Tremor Slam mechanics from the main mobs just before pull. Be sure to loosely stack ahead of Umbral Weave (to help burn the incapacitating adds) and tank should be ready to pick up the Ravenous Scarabs that spawn after Tremor Slam casts. To complicate these, boss will cast Shifting Anomalies on pull, spawning orbs that will intermittently move, dealing shadow damage and knocking back any players hit. 

After a time, boss will cast Process of Elimination, which is a tank buster that deals heavy shadow damage in pulses to the target (once for each shadow orb). Any friendlies caught within 10 yds of the tank will also take heavy physical damage.

Rinse and repeat to victory.

core abilities:

- Shifting Anomalies - *avoid orbs and their intermittent movement*: getting hit deals shadow dmg and knocks back
- Splice - *unavoidable shadow dot to everyone in party*
- Umbral Weave - *loosely stack and help burn incap adds*
- Tremor Slam - *nature dmg to group and additional nature dmg to anyone in 12 yd proximity, dodge poop that spawn Ravenous Scarabs*
- Process of Elimination - ***tank buster*** *dealing shadow damage to tank 3 times in succession (once for each shadow orb)*: friendlies within 10 yds of tank will take heavy physical dmg

mobs:

- Ravenous Scarab (ID 219198)
  - Gorge - physical dmg to target, increases stacks of Gorged
  - Gutburst - *on 5 stacks of Gorged, suicides with large pulses of aoe nature dmg (lasting 4 sec)*
