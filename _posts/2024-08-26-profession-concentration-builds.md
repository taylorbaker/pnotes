# General Strat

Reach for the "low-hanging fruit" in TWW profession progress and lean on the value provided by an alt army's worth of Concentration. Equip alts to be early or barely into r2 crafting to allow for "Concentration boosting" the craft to r3.

attainable profession progress:

- 1st-craft bonuses
- profession treasures (24 knowledge available per proff)

low-hanging fruit target:

- 60 - 70 profession skill
- 60 profession knowledge
- uncommon profession gear (stacking Multicrafting unless noted otherwise)


Get x350 [Artisan's Acuity](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/item=210814/artisans-acuity) from a quest to look and point at the Crafting Order npcs. Provides a solid start on profession gear with pieces from the appropriate vendor in Dornogal.

# Blacksmithing

## Smelt Alloys

![TWW Beta Blacksmithing Smelt Alloys Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-blacksmithing-smelt-alloys-build.png)

Smelt Sanctified, Charged, Ironclaw, and Core Alloys with r2 mats and Concentration.

Expect heavy market drop-off once ~250 overall skill is attainable, but will be very strong until then.


## Armorsmithing

Not a long-term build (to stay stagnant on).

![TWW Beta Blacksmithing Armorsmithing Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-blacksmithing-armorsmith-build.png)

Goes after rushing 250 recipe difficulty crafted blues in whichever tree desired. Intended to swap off after ~250 is generally accessible to a higher-end, more specialized armorsmithing build or to another profession's concentration build altogether.

Recommended to stack Resourcefulness for rare armor gear crafts.


## Profession Gear

![TWW Beta Blacksmithing Profession Gear Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-blacksmithing-profession-gear-build.png)

Targets uncommon profession gear (req 250 skill) early into rare quality with higher concentration.

## Stoner

![TWW Beta Blacksmithing Stoner Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-blacksmithing-stoner-build.png)

Targets crafting the various stones used to enhance crafting stats and secondary (Weightstones) stats.

Choose between 20 knowledge in Weapons vs Tools (prob weps).


## Weaponsmith

Not a long-term build (to stay stagnant on).

![TWW Beta Blacksmithing Weaponsmith Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-blacksmithing-weaponsmith-build.png)

Targets 250 skill weapons, which is high relative to other entry-level profession crafts. Has choice on where to spend last 25 knowledge. Also short-term unless developing this as a main profession. Consider swapping to other profession concentration build after ~250 skill is generally accessible.


# Engineering

## Parts

![TWW Beta Engineering Parts Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-engineering-parts-build.png)

Targets everything in "Parts" section with r2 specs and Concentration. Unsure how much competition there will be with the "scour through" system.


## Box o' Booms

![TWW Beta Engineering Bomb Build 1](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-engineering-bomb-build-1.png)
![TWW Beta Engineering Bomb Build 2](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-engineering-bomb-build-2.png)

Targets Box o' Booms, daily cd that unlocks group utility potions that seem interesting for M+ (Potion Bomb of Speed, Power, Recovery). Yield will be very dependent on how meta these pots end up being.

Box o' Booms can't multi-proc, so stack something other than multicraft.


## Profession Gear

![TWW Beta Engineering Profession Gear Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-engineering-parts-build.png)

Recipes will be drip-fed through daily "Discovery" cd.


## Invent Boost

![TWW Beta Engineering Invent Boost Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-engineering-invent-boost-build.png)

Targets Devices and any other non-quality (no rank 1-3) crafts that will get good value out of the higher Resourcefulness and Multicraft available through the invention buff. If you have other engineers or other access to a lot of low-quality engineering mats, this build would be a great sink.


# Alchemy

Actually relatively easy to get to 100 skill. Discover a recipe, then make that to 100. Brilliant. However, relatively slow to gain knowledge, as recipes are trickle-discovered through daily cd and the bulk of initial knowledge will come from first crafts.

## Flasks

![TWW Beta Alchemy Flasks Build 1](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-alchemy-flasks-build-1.png)
![TWW Beta Alchemy Flasks Build 2](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-alchemy-flasks-build-2.png)

The 25 pts in Alchemical Mastery associate with each available TWW herb. Each herb is used in the recipes for two flasks, so there is a lot of room for strategic knowledge investment.

Flask of Alchemical Chaos is a likely hot sell/good target.


## Potions

![TWW Beta Alchemy Potions Build 1](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-alchemy-potions-build-1.png)
![TWW Beta Alchemy Potions Build 2](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-alchemy-potions-build-2.png)

As described in the [[TWW Beta Professions - Concentration Builds#Alchemy#Flasks|Flasks build]], the 25 pt investment in Alchemical Mastery can be placed in any end node, each corresponding to an available TWW herb. Investment in these end nodes give a crafting bonus to the two flask recipes that use that herb.

Believe potions will be the better pick for personal use, but flasks for playing the AH/general use.


## Theamaturgy


![TWW Beta Alchemy Theamaturgy Build](https://taylorbaker.github.io/pnotes/assets/images/twwbeta-alchemy-theamaturgy-build.png)

Knowledge investment in Theamaturgy primarily to unlock Gleaming Transmutagems and fully investing in that tree. Gleaming Transmutagem craft offers a very lucrative daily first-craft bonus and is used for the crafting of various epic-quality JC mats.
